# Friendship-LibraryHTML

*What is it?* This project is an HTML web design made for a school project. The assignment was to create a web page for a local non-profit, and I chose the Friendship Library in PA. In this project, I went through the process of gathering resources, planning, wireframing, and creating the final project. This web layout shows my ability to effectively work through the process of designing and creating a web page in HTML.

This repository includes the following:
- Contents from the site's planning phases, such as the design breif and color palette.
- The site's wireframe design.
- A mockup of the site created in Photoshop before writing the HTML for the final site.
- The working HTML created after finalizing the site details.
